    name: "Mercury",
    quote: "Our story didn't begin with fireworks — just a spark. Quiet. Curious. Magnetic.",
    story: `It started small. Like Mercury — close, hot, intense, but unnoticed by most. You were just another name in a space filled with strangers. I wasn't looking for anything… until you spoke. Your messages weren't loud or dramatic. They were gentle. Thoughtful. A soft flicker I couldn't ignore.

There was something in the way you responded — patient, present, kind. And somehow, that slow unraveling became my favorite part of the day. You didn't chase me. You didn't rush me. You just showed up. And little by little, that presence ignited something new.

That was Mercury — the smallest planet, yet the one that burned the brightest when we met.`

  {
    name: "Venus",
    quote: "You don't say it in grand ways — but when you love, it wraps around me like stardust.",
    story: `Venus is where our tenderness lives. It's where the texts say "take care," but mean "don't go." It's where you call me "baby" in that sleepy voice, and I melt.

There's a kind of softness in your love — not loud, not dramatic — but felt everywhere. The way you remember what I like. The way you say goodnight even when you're tired. The way you check in with a simple, "you okay?" but mean so much more.

In this rose-colored planet, the skies blush just like I do. Everything feels safe, gentle, and beautiful — like being wrapped in your hoodie, or falling asleep on a call to the sound of your breath. Venus is where we loved without needing to say it — because we already felt it.`

  {
    name: "Earth",
    quote: "Your voice became the one I wanted to fall asleep to. Your presence — my safe place.",
    story: `On Earth, love is real. Tangible. It's the laughter in our late-night calls. The comfort in watching anime together. The weird nicknames. The shared playlists. The way your presence makes everything feel okay.

I never thought I'd find peace in someone's voice — but yours? It's my calm. You made this chaotic world feel bearable. Your care wasn't just in your words, but in how you listened, how you remembered small details, how you never let a day end with a fight.

Earth isn't flashy. It's grounding. It's real. And that's what you've always been to me — not a fantasy, but a real reason to believe in love.`
  },
  {
    name: "Mars",
    quote: "Our storms aren't signs of weakness — they're proof that we care enough to stay.",
    story: `Mars is our battlefield — not of war, but of passion. We've had arguments, silence, tears. I overthink. You stay calm. I storm out. You wait. Somehow, we always find our way back.

It's not always easy — but it's always real. You've seen me at my most dramatic, my most distant, my most emotional. But you never left. You teased me until I smiled. You gave me space when I needed it. You came back when I didn't know how to ask.

Mars reminds me that love isn't always peaceful — but the people who are worth it, stay through the chaos. You stayed. That means more than you know.`
  },
  {
    name: "Jupiter",
    quote: "You're not just the boy I love. You're the person I look up to the most.",
    story: `Jupiter is massive. Majestic. Impossible to miss — just like the respect I have for you. You're intelligent, grounded, and gentle in the ways that matter. When you talk about your dreams, I listen in awe. Not just because you're smart — but because you're passionate.

You never boast, yet you shine. You never flaunt, yet I see how you carry the weight of others quietly. You've made me want to be better — not for you, but with you. That's the kind of love that builds people up.

Jupiter is where I fell in love with your mind — and stayed for your heart.`
  },
  {
    name: "Saturn",
    quote: "You didn't try to change me. You just understood me. And that changed everything.",
    story: `Saturn is where we grew. You weren't intimidated by my overthinking. You respected my silence. You understood things I never explained.

You're the kind of person who reads between the lines — who listens even when I don't speak. You challenged me in gentle ways. You reminded me that love isn't about fixing. It's about witnessing. And you witnessed me — every part — without judgment.

In this ringed world of quiet strength, I found the kind of love that doesn't fade. The kind that stays — even when everything else is spinning.`

  {
    name: "Neptune",
    quote: "You saw my sadness, and instead of walking away, you stayed. That's love.",
    story: `Neptune holds the ocean of my heart. Sometimes messy. Sometimes silent. Sometimes overwhelming. But you never ran. You sat with me in the dark. You didn't say "cheer up." You said, "I'm here."

You didn't offer answers. You offered space. Your love was never loud — but it was steady. Consistent. Healing. And in a world that tells you to hide your feelings, you let mine breathe.

Neptune is where I realized — love isn't always about sunshine. Sometimes it's about sitting together in the storm and still reaching for each other's hand.`
